#Mini-Project: Methods

Complete the following methods with the given signatures. All user input and output must occur in your main
method. You are permitted to create other methods if you feel they would help you complete the task. Call your
java file Methods. This is to be submitted to Classroom by the date posted on Classroom.

- In your main method, display a menu to ask the user for their desired calculation. The options are listed below.

- public static int factorial(int n)
  - This method takes a nonnegative integer as a parameter and returns the product n * (n – 1) * … * 2 * 1.
- public static int sumOfDigits(int n)
  - This method takes a nonnegative integer as a parameter and returns the sum of its digits.
- public static boolean isPerfect(int n)
  - This method takes a nonnegative integer and returns true if the number is a perfect number; false otherwise.
- public static double averageDigit(int n)
  - This method takes a nonnegative integer and returns the average of the digits in the number.
- public static boolean hasMidpoint(int a, int b, int c)
  - This method takes three integers as parameters and returns true if the average of any two of them is the third.

- This project will be graded on:
  - Documentation (4 points): Your code must be fully commented and employ standard Java-style conventions.
  - User-Friendliness (4 points): All interactions with the user must be clear and unambiguous.
  - Methods (10 points): Each method has the proper signature and works as expected.
TOTAL: 18 points
