# MiniProject ArrayMethods

Complete the following methods with the given signatures. All user input and output must occur in your main method. You are permitted to create other methods if you feel they would help you complete the task. Call your java file ArrayMethods. This is to be submitted to Classroom by the date posted on Classroom. You are only completing one java file for this mini-project. For this program, you may use Scanner or JOptionPane.

In your main method, display a menu to ask the user for their desired task. The options are listed below. Once the user chooses a task, ask them for their desired array size. Then, prompt them to fill the array with integer values. When displaying an array, all entries must be on the same line (see below for sample output). When the process is complete, ask the user if they want to do it again. As a hint, you will need to use loops for each of these methods.

The order in which I run your methods should not affect the outcome. In other words, none of your methods may change the original array in any way.

- public static int[] reverseArray(int[] arr)
  - This method takes an integer array as a parameter and returns the array in reverse order.
- public static int smallestValue(int[] arr)
  - This method takes an integer array as a parameter and returns the smallest value in the array.
- public static int largestValue(int[] arr)
  - This method takes an integer array as a parameter and returns the largest value in the array.

This project will be graded on:
1. Documentation (4 points): Your code must be fully commented and employ standard Java-style
conventions.
2. User-Friendliness (4 points): All interactions with the user must be clear and unambiguous.
3. Methods (12 points): Each method has the proper signature and works as expected.
TOTAL: 20 points
Example runs of the program:

```
1. Reverse an array
2. Smallest element of an array
3. Largest element of an array
Enter your choice: 1
Enter the number of elements: 6
Enter element 0: -3
Enter element 1: 4
Enter element 2: 12
Enter element 3: 19
Enter element 4: -8
Enter element 5: 0
You entered: -3 4 12 19 -8 0
In reverse: 0 -8 19 12 4 -3
Again? (1 for yes, 2 for no): 1
