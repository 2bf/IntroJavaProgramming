# Lesson 19 (Visibility modifiers and encapsulation)

Write the code for a Java standalone class, using the information from the Do Now from Lesson 16. Save the class as StudentInfo.java. Donâ€™t forget to include all necessary instance variables, constructors, helper and service methods, and a toString method. Create StudentInfoDriver.java to test it.
