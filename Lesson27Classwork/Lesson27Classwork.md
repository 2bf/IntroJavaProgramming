# Lesson 26 (Intro to Arrays)

1. Write a program that declares and instantiates an array a[] of size 1000 and accesses a[1000]. Does your program compile? What happens when you run it?
2. Describe and explain what happens when you try to compile the program HugeArray.java
3. Given two vectors of length N that are represented with one- dimensional arrays, write a code fragment that computes the Euclidean distance between them (the square root of the sums of the squares of the differences between corresponding entries).

In other words, if your arrays are {2, 1, 3} and {7, -1, 0}, your program should calculate (7-2) 2 + (-1-1) 2 + (0-3) 2 and then take the square root, giving an answer of approximately 6.16.
