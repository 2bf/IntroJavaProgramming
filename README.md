# introjavaprogramming

This repository is simply a compilation of the work I did in my high school Intro to Java & Programming class (2022-2023).
It is pretty simple code, because it's just a high school level class. I am taking it as a prerequisite for AP Computer Science the year after.

The .md file in each lesson folder is the assignment task, given by the teacher. The .java file is the actual Java program, written by me, and submitted as work to the teacher.
