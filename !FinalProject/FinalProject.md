# Final Project 
For the project, you must research and use something in Java that we have not covered this year. For your paper, you are to explain what you researched, how you used it, and what problems you encountered. The paper must be 2 pages, written in 12pt Times New Roman, double-spaced, with 1-in margins. Please note that diagrams and code samples do NOT count towards the page requirement. Please upload your paper as a PDF (only a PDF...I don't want any formatting issues).
The other requirement besides the java files is that you must make a (short..like one minute) presentation about your project. Your presentation must include a demo of the project so I can see how YOU want it to be used. In addition, you must say what you learned for the project and how you incorporated it into your program. Please upload the video to the assignment on Classroom with your program.
The project proposal assignment will be posted separately.
