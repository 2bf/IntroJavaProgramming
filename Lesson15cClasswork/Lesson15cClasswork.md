# Lesson 15c Classwork (JOptionPane)

- Create a guessing game using JOptionPane windows. Your program should ask the user to think of a number and then should try to guess it. The only information you can provide is whether the guess is too high or too low. Keep track of how many tries it took to guess. See screenshots below for how the game should look.
