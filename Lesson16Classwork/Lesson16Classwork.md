Ash Ketcham has decided that his Pokédex could totally be
improved. He wants to store the following information for a
given Pokémon:
- Name
- Number
- Type
- Health
- Level

In addition, he wants you to write a method for his Pokémon
class that allows the Pokémon to level up.
- public void levelUp()

Plus, as a Pokémon trainer, it is important for you to know if
your Pokémon are healthy or if they have fainted (a
Pokémon has fainted if its current health is ≤ 0).
- public boolean hasFainted()

And don’t forget! Your Pokémon can speak, too! He speaks
by saying his name twice, but has a space in between.
- public String speak()
