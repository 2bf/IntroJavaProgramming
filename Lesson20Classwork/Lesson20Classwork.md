# Lesson 20 Classwork (Method Overloading)

1. Write one method called sumRange that accepts two integer parameters that represent a range. Issue an error message and return zero if the second parameter is less than the first. Otherwise, the method should return the sum of the integers in that range (inclusive).
2. Overload the sumRange method to accept floating point numbers.
